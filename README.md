# SA Vaccine Numbers

A small experiment to get the daily vaccination numbers in South Africa. Then send the numbers to twitter or something.

## Still a Work in Progress (WIP)

## How

The NICD is publishing data to a power bi dashboard here [https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics/](https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics/). So I am trying to read this data with a [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) script and write the results to a json file.

Will try to keep the scraper up to date when things change

## Why

I don't really know what I'm doing. I wanted a simple vaccine number tracker to watch, can't wait till I'm allowed to get mine. If you think this is not useful or detrimental to the vaccine efforts let me know an I'll consider taking this down.

## Disclaimer

I got no affiliation with any health departments or government in South Africa. These numbers are read from the dashboard on [https://sacoronavirus.co.za/](https://sacoronavirus.co.za/). There are some disclaimers on this data on the dashboard page [https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics/](https://sacoronavirus.co.za/latest-vaccine-statistics/). The scaped data collected might be wrong if the dashboard is changed.
